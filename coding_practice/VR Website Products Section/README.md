- Stack them vertically for smaller devices (XS, SM).
- Each product should have:

#### 🌈 3. Apply the Given CSS Colors

Use the following colors in your section:

| Element           | Color Code |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Headings/Text     | `#1f2933`  |
| Button Background | `#1754a1`  |

#### 📱 4. Make it Responsive

- On small screens, stack the product cards vertically.
- On medium and larger screens, display them side by side using Bootstrap’s grid system.

### 📝 **Tips**

- Use Bootstrap’s `col-12`, `col-md-6` for layout responsiveness.
- Use `btn`, `btn-primary` or your custom class for styling the button.
- Apply padding and margins using Bootstrap spacing classes (`p-3`, `m-2`, etc.).
- Wrap each product in a `card` or a custom `div` with `shadow` and `rounded` for modern UI.
