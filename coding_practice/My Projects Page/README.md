## üîç Important Notes

- All section containers must have an `id` with the prefix `section`, like:
```html
  <div id="sectionHomePage">...</div>
```

* **Avoid nesting sections** inside each other. Each section must be parallel.

* **Do NOT** apply Bootstrap `d-flex` or similar display properties directly to section containers.

* Use only the font **"Bree Serif"** and follow the specified **text color hex codes** if styling is extended.

---

## üí° Additional Suggestions

* You can add more project thumbnails if desired.
* Try to match the design as close as possible to the reference `.gif`.
* Enhance user experience with hover effects or transitions.
